Note that this principle is less general than the principle of substitutivity for
equalities, because it only applies to expressions that are built from integers and
certain operations (note that division is not one of these operations). But it still lets
us prove analogues of our above examples (51) and (52):
• If n is any integer, and if a, b, c, d, e, c′ are integers such that c ≡ c′ mod n, then
the principle of substitutivity for congruences says that we can replace c by
c′ in the expression a (b − (c + d) e), and the value of the resulting expression
a (b − (c′ + d) e) will be congruent to the value of a (b − (c + d) e) modulo n;
that is, we have
a (b − (c + d) e) ≡ a b − c′ + $$
$$ mod n. (53)
• If n is any integer, and if a, b, c, a′ are integers such that a ≡ a′ mod n, then
(a − b) (a + b) ≡ a′ −  (a + b) mod n, (54)
because the principle of substitutivity allows us to replace the first a appear-
ing in the expression (a − b) (a + b) by an a′. (We can also replace the second
a by a′, of course.)
We shall not prove the principle of substitutivity for congruences, since we have
not formalized it (after all, we have not defined what an “expression” is). But
we shall prove the specific congruences (53) and (54) using Proposition 2.21 and
Proposition 2.12; the way in which we prove these congruences is symptomatic:
Every congruence obtained from the principle of substitutivity for congruences can
be proven in a manner like these. Thus, we hope that the proofs of (53) and (54)
given below serve as templates which can easily be adapted to any other situation
in which an application of the principle of substitutivity for congruences needs to
be justified.
